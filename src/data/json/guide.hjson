						• To keep the Economy more fair to the Active user base whilst making sure the Rich don't keep getting richer, we've introduced a System of Tax deductions according to different tax Brackets. But Taxes aren't just a 1-sided sucking of your Cash reserves, there's way more to it.
						• *The higher your Tax bracket is, you'll have **MORE Bank Space** and your **Daily tax deductance would __INCREASE__** respectively too*.

						• All users can reduce the overall amount they lose to taxes by doing Tax Returns, availing Tax Benefits as soon as they upgrade Tax Bracket for the first time.
						• Whenever you reach the __Higher Tax Brackets__: **Tier-Ⅳ** & **Tier-Ⅴ**, you'll be able to unlock VIP Benefits. These are the elite perks like **Loans**, **Raids**, and more...

						**Learn more about Taxes by typing: `{prefix}tax`**
